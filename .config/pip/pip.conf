[global]
break-system-packages = true
# NOTE: Avoid adding 'user = true' under [global].
# Doing so forces pip to default to user-scheme installs, which conflicts
# with virtual environment installations (e.g., for Mason-managed Python tools)
# and leads to packages not being found or misconfigured in their venvs.

# Keep 'user = true' absent or explicitly set 'user = false' if needed elsewhere.
